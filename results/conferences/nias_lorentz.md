# **Summary**

All over the world migrants have left multiple traces, deep traces that are indispensable for the fostering of heritage communities and for research in the humanities and social sciences. Yet the growing societal demand for cultural services and the increasingly insufficient resources available to manage migrants&#39; cultural heritage is creating a gap -- one difficult to bridge even as the importance of cultural heritage to a country&#39;s economy and social capital is widely recognized (most recently in 2014 by the Council of the European Union adoption of the _Conclusions on cultural heritage as a strategic resource for a sustainable Europe_).1This workshop responds to this key challenge of how to preserve and enhance transnational public and community memory practices through new digital technologies. Because heritage can be both a focus of research and a source for cultural engagement, especially in the construction of meaning and identity, new digital architectures and new digital preservation techniques and Linked Open Data standards offer new possibilities for scholars and migrant community members alike.

The central research question addressed in this workshop therefore is how to develop standards and strategies for linking the diverse resources through digital methods, community governance and sustainable practices. It explores cultural heritage from a wide range of social science and humanities perspectives and disciplines that include leading representatives from academia, the archives, libraries and museums (both public and private) sector. It provides a distinctive and major intersection into contemporary memory mediation practices as currently researched, understood and practiced around the world within the context of developing an international standard for linking collections. At present, these advancements are unevenly deployed in terms of institutional realization, infrastructure development, copyright awareness, regional policy alignment, stakeholder management, and community empowerment and education. The transnational nature of the migration movement also poses new challenges in the realms of organization, preservation and infrastructure. This workshop will address all these issues in a daily mix of general lectures, discussions and working sessions.

Bringing together for the first time ever global leaders working in cultural heritage and digital technologies, this workshop will examine memory institution practices at both the public and private level in a time of profound social, political and technological change. Critically, it will respond to the problems facing efforts to preserve cultural heritage through devising and showcasing inventive digital experiments, empirical research and innovative digital approaches that link across migrant heritage collections in preservation, connection and dissemination.

The workshop will have two white papers as outcome: one on cultural heritage and data linkingfor the more institutional stakeholders and one on infrastructure (for developers with suggestions on dissemination to a broader public.

**Scientific Case**

Migration memory is dispersed across multiple countries, making the history of migration truly international in character and vast in scope. The very large migration movements following the Second World War have left deep traces in people&#39;s lived experiences and in their home and host countries. These consist of traumatic personal memories, as well as physical documents such as manuscripts, letters, photographs and objects that are now very widely dispersedâ€“ including fragments in private and public collections, records stewarded by the institutional archives of (supra) national and local governments, and others under the care of NGOs, museums, libraries and individual migrants. In the second half of the twentieth century alone, half a million Dutch migrants migrated to overseas countries of settlement (including Australia, Canada, the United States, South Africa and Brazil) and there were comparable streams of migrants from other parts of the world -- people looking for a temporary or permanent new home in response to political or economic vilification. Little has changed in modern times.

There is a growing awareness of and interest in the heritage of migrants in cultural institutions and within migrant communities. Seen from a worldwide perspective, all migrants form part of ethnic groups and always are a minority in the countries of settlement. UNESCO and ICOMOS signaled an urgent need for preserving community heritage in its 2003 and 2004 reports. A major finding was that museums are facing unprecedented pressures due to the difficulty of preserving cultural heritage resources in a time of accelerated economic upheaval and the improbability that museums can cope with housing newly discovered collections that reflect a nation&#39;s ethnic diversity. Crucially, the UNESCO charter noted that a template aimed at the preservation of immigrants&#39; cultural heritage would be key to confronting these challenges.

The proposed NIAS Lorentz Workshop is the next step in a continuing international effort to raise awareness of the importance of preserving and communicating migrant cultural heritage and find solutions to address this major global issue. It builds directly on the symposium recently held in Sydney, Australia, entitled &#39;Migration, Mobility and Connection: Towards a Sustainable Model for the Preservation of Immigrant Cultural Heritage&#39;, which was sponsored by the Embassy of the Kingdom of the Netherlands, Curtin University, Western Sydney University, Huygens ING, the Dutch Australian Cultural Centre, the Australian National Maritime Museum and the Centre for European Studies at the Australian National University.

Conceptualized as a case study on Dutch-Australian mutual cultural heritage, the Sydney symposium set out to examine the archival, custodial and digital challenges that impact the discovery, collection, preservation and content management of material and immaterial traces from the past of the maritime, military, migration and mercantile history that the Netherlands shares with Australia and New Zealand. In partnership with key institutional and community stakeholders, the workshop achieved its goal of building new understandings of the experience and representation of migration and highlighting how this has more broadly shaped an evolving sense of Dutch-Australasian heritage and, with it, the formation of cultural identities. It posed the question, how we should preserve this vital cultural heritage and who should hold responsibility?

For the Dutch-Australian migrant community, the availability of archives makes it feasible to study many aspects of migration in greater detail as there are complete emigration and immigration records (see, for example, the Migration, Mobility and Connections project). For comparable groups of migrants, different fragments of cultural heritage have survived. In the Dutch-Brazilian case, for instance, there were far fewer migrants and yet members of the migrant community have shown great interest in digitizing material traces (see, for example, the Tulipana project). In many cases archives and other collections of papers and artefacts have been lost because they were never saved, were not transferred to an archive or museum, or because personal papers were lost to age, destroyed by an occasional fire or simply because the migrant or their family discarded them.

Given the highly mobile nature of modern global society, the sustainable preservation of migrants&#39; cultural heritage has worldwide relevance beyond the Dutch-Australian case study. Yet to date this issue has been poorly addressed and fundamental questions relating to how to digitally preserve and organize migrant materials and historical traces remain unanswered. For example, at the Sydney symposium it was recognized that many Dutch community groups in most Australian States and in New Zealand are actively collecting documents, artefacts, photographs and maps to pass on to future generations. However, few have developed sustainable workflows to ensure the longevity of their collections and rarely are they familiar with cataloguing and metadata conventions, which help describe an item&#39;s provenance, role and position in the world and make it possible to structure and connect collections. Planning for digital preservation therefore is irregular, leading to concerns about a &#39;digital gap&#39; in these communities&#39; histories. Mitigating the deleterious effects then of information loss and fading human recollection is an issue central to both the continued accessibility of cultural heritage materials and the digital preservation of historical knowledge beyond technology format lifetimes, a problem not localized to Australia or New Zealand only. A coordinated international approach is now required and has become an urgent priority. This forms the rationale for the proposed workshop.

In view of the recent comments by Vint Cerf, current Vice President of Google --- that if &quot;we&#39;re thinking 1,000 years ... ahead in the future, we have to ask ourselves, how do we preserve all the bits that we need in order to correctly interpret the digital objects we create?&quot; -- then the oft-assumed salve of digital preservation becomes even more important, and yet the way forward is not yet clear, even for Google. Given the clear need to prioritize migrant heritage internationally, and in view of the findings of the Sydney symposium, the NIAS Lorentz workshop will examine the importance of migration as a global constitutive force in the past half century. The workshop is therefore part of a wider movement in both cultural heritage institutions and in academia around the world. In addition to the Australian symposium mentioned above, linked initiatives have included the International Association of Labour History Institutions (IALHI) organization of the Theme Day &#39;Global Connections in Labour History: Collecting and Discovering Migrant Workers&#39; Heritage&#39; during their 46th Annual Conference in September 2015.

**Key Issues:**

1.             At the migrant level, members from these communities are custodians of the cultural heritage of their families or local communities in analogue and sometimes digital form. Increasingly these communities are interested in safeguarding their heritage objects through digitization in addition to tracing their family, cultural identity and linking their materials to a wider ethnic context â€“ and yet few have the technical skills to do so, pointing to a need to create an underlying infrastructure that can facilitate this on a larger scale.

2.             At the public sector level, cultural heritage institutions (such as libraries, archives, and museums) preserve those parts of migrant cultural heritage that are sourced from historical government activities, the documents of migrant associations, and the artefacts and memorabilia of key individuals&#39; estates. Though the collections are connected to migrants, they take different forms depending on the provenance of collections. Increasingly, collections are being made available digitally but only selectively. Collections are typically exhibited in isolation from one another, even when they contain information about the same individual or events. The cross-national dispersion of materials linking to the same people reinforces the fragmentary nature of cultural heritage understanding and provides justification for this research.

3.             At the academic level, researchers have the analytical skills to connect different documents together and link materials to the wider history of global migration. Their aim is often to present a representative story of migrants (not per se individuals) but they are not always aware of the existence and variety of alternative collections that may add a different angle to their research. For most researchers the individual experience is not the most important part of the analysis.

Overall, there is a growing awareness of the significance of migrant heritage to understanding the world today. The complex situation resulting from the fragmentation of heritage materials and the different stakeholder contexts outlined above, however, has created tensions in the priorities of cultural heritage digitization, accessibility and in the stories that can and should be told. Yet even if there is considerable variety in the situation of migration community cultural heritage from country to country and from migration group to migration group, migration heritage worldwide has common traits, making it possible to devise a common template and a methodology to assist in connecting the fragments of cultural heritage.

The central focus in a migration heritage template must be the migrant. A migrant may be identified in government archives by way of migration registrations recording his/her departure, travel or arrival. Migrants can be identified as members of groups that were recruited for migration or settled in the land of destination. Migrants can become members of migrant associations, and they may also apply for help from governments, social security, or funds of assistance. In turn, government and civil society organizations, churches and other NGOs interact with migrants. Migrants also leave memorabilia such as letters, diaries, official documentation and photos that provide vital information about themselves and the groups they are part of. All these actions leave evidence on paper or in artefacts that form part of the cultural heritage of a single migrant, their social groups and migrant communities at large. Each of these traces can be seen as representative instances of the life course of a migrant.

In order to investigate and generate comprehensive data about Dutch-Australian migration historically, a consortium consisting of Huygens ING, Western Sydney University and Curtin University has begun to reconstruct a database of life courses of virtually all Dutch-Australian migrants from 1945 to 1992. The core is formed by collections of emigrant registration cards from the National Archives in The Hague and immigrant records from the National Archives of Australia. Both contain data about more than ninety percent of all Dutch-Australian migrants from this period. This will form the backbone to which many more materials with information about migrants can be connected. This will benefit researchers, who will be able to conduct analyses on arbitrary subgroups of these migrants and compare them in time and place with other subgroups with different characteristics. At the same time, this work is aimed at the migrant community, where they will be able to locate family members, correct and complete the data and annotations, and contribute digitized items from their own family holdings (photos, letters etc.). In this way:

1.             The migrant community can reconstruct their family heritage and connect it to a larger history;

2.             The collections of many different cultural heritage institutions can be virtually connected, and opened up to a wider public; and

3.             Researchers can conduct research that would otherwise have been inconceivable or very time consuming to reconstruct from multiple dispersed sources.

In conclusion, the study of migration must contextualize the movement of people across space and time â€“ historically, culturally and systemically â€“ and explicate the interconnected social, material and temporal dimensions of private and public migrant archival holdings around the world. The dynamic links and interdependencies to be discovered among collections, practices and the fragmentary records of migrant social arrangements and activities can unearth new analytic focuses and understandings regarding the history of global migration. For this, we need a new conceptual vocabulary and toolkit to unpack the multiple, shifting configurations of migration that occurs on multiple scales and time frames. In addressing the challenges of connecting dispersed collections from many different libraries, archives and museums as well as private collections from the community, a joint effort is required from cultural heritage owners, cultural heritage experts, (digital) humanities scholars and computer science researchers. In the NIAS Lorentz workshop we will interrogate the practical, technical, financial and organizational issues that co-combine in the digital recording and preservation of migrant heritage. Central to this is creating new connections between different collections while ensuring materials remain with their owners. The workshop will be a success if this involvement of key global stakeholders concludes with the beginnings of a template for linking the digital preservation of dispersed cultural heritage materials in a way that enables migrant communities and researchers alike to investigate their roots.



**Workshop Outline**

The workshop will be organized over five days. Day 1 will provide an overview of the current state of affairs and a review of best practices; Day 2 will focus on the conceptualization of a template for connecting and studying migrant cultural heritages. On the remaining three days we will elaborate on the conceptual and practical challenges such efforts pose to all institutions, researchers and (migrant) communities involved. The speakers will be asked for introductions and â€“ if applicable â€“ for provocative statements or signaling blind spots on which the participants can work during the day and the week.

The sessions consists of a morning and an afternoon part. We choose for dialogues (statements and questions of 10-15 minutes maximum) instead of papers where we expect input from every one for the daily sessions 2 and 3. Where applicable there will be demonstrations/ hands-on sessions (especially day 3). Every day will end with a &#39;summary of ideas and actions&#39; in relation to the objectives. Each day has a number of clear objectives (see below), so we will be able to move from one day to the other in identifying and solving challenges and issues. Day 5 will end with forming preparation groups for the white papers, a round-up and a list of actions necessary for the next steps.

**Day 1: The Methodological Underpinnings of Migrant Heritage Studies**

This day will provide an overview of migrant heritage studies and set the scene with questions about how to understand migration as a ubiquitous global phenomenon. The session will be considered a success when:

- --There is a shared overview of the current state of affairs in research perspectives: what do we know, what areas are still underexplored;
- --There is an overview of what the different disciplines contribute to migrant studies;
- --We explore the differences and the tensions between alternative perspectives on migrant heritage and study, and identify where bridges are needed; and
- --All parties concerned are prepared to explore new territories.

_Interactions: On the first day_ the methodological underpinnings of global heritage studies aims at getting all participants from different backgrounds to share the issues we identified. In our experience, participants from different backgrounds have rather different and sometimes opposing perceptions of what the key issues in migrant heritage are. We have outlined some of the differences in the proposal. This session needs the input of all participants to get key issues and the tensions between them out into the open.



# **Day 2: Diversity and Connection in Migrant Cultural Heritage**

This session will conceptualize and architect a template for connecting dispersed migrant cultural heritage materials and will examine the benefits this brings for the study of migrants for all concerned. Day 2 will be considered a success when:

- --We understand the possibilities of migrant life stories via a data backbone created for connecting other types of information;
- --We obtain insight in unexpected connections to other types of cultural heritage;
- --We see future possibilities for collaborating on virtual heritage sustainability and hosting.

_Interactions: On the second day_ the data backbone is discussed. Data scientists and digital humanities scholars demonstrate the possibilities for data connection, contextualization and enrichment. The input and requirements of researchers, cultural heritage institutions and the migrant community are needed to obtain a full perspective of the possibilities and limitations of the data backbone and as a test of the soundness of taking migrant life courses as our focus. Another issue to be discussed is the sustainability of a virtual and transnational heritage resource and its ownership. This is a challenge where the research community, the cultural heritage institutions and global parties may help to find beginnings of an answer.



# **Day 3: Linked Data and Heritage, the Dutch Migrant Minorities as Case Studies**

This session will examine the utility of connected collections for both research, cultural heritage and the migrant communities. Day 3 will be considered a success when:

- --We obtain insight into new research possibilities emerging from connected collections;
- --We take clear steps towards an integrated interconnected platform that shows heritage from many sources available to the public and researchers in particular;

- --We get a clear understanding of what an integrated platform for migrant heritage sources should provide to which stakeholders, users and heritage owners in terms of information, stories, data, research tools;

- --We have a clear understanding of tools and training needs for heritage owners, community members and individuals who want to digitally donate their migrant heritage and/or enhance it with data and descriptions, and

- --We identify the difficulties in answering the question of ownership of such a platform.

_Interactions: The third__day_ is about funnel_ing crowdsourcing activities. When_ many different people work on distributed resources, chaos is always imminent. We would like to bring together expertise in user enabling and moderation from a humanities research, a data science, community involvement, cultural heritage institutions and infrastructure and sustainability perspective as they all have different expectations (and sometimes prejudices against), involvements and experiences with crowd participation.



# **Day 4: Metadata and Heritage in Context**

This session will explore best practices in crowdsourcing and identify appropriate methods for structuring distributed human intelligence tasking in meaningful ways. Day 4 will be considered a success when:

- --There is a new perspective on the role of heritage in the forming and expression of ethnic identity; and
- --We obtain insight into the comparability of ethnicity as a common phenomenon and the role of heritage.

- --We understand the possibilities of connected collections for collection holding institutions (&#39;liberating the collection&#39;).

_Interactions: The fourth__day_ is devoted to the new possibilities that linked data and connections and their contextualizations offer for research and ethnic identity formation. Here we seek the contribution of researchers from different humanities backgrounds to offer fresh perspectives, but also from community representatives and participants working on community involvement and cultural heritage institutions.



# **Day 5: Participation in Cultural Heritage; Closing Session**

This session concludes the workshop with an examination of community involvement, &#39;guerilla&#39; archiving and community empowerment. Day 5 will be considered a success when:

- --We get insight in the perspectives in crowd sourcing to make community-held heritage outside the cultural heritage institutions digitally available;
- --We have an insight into the possibilities and pitfalls of crowdsourcing metadata for heritage materials;

- --We obtain an overview of the steps to involve migrant communities into digitizing and connecting heritage materials and
- --An understanding in the practical role of digital resources for community awareness; and, finally
- --We can conclude with clear perspectives on future steps and collaborations.

_Interactions: The fifth__day_ is about the possibilities for digitizing the migrant cultural heritage that is outside cultural heritage institutions. This has an organizational side (where does the content go to, how do we get the community to contribute their memorabilia) but also a technical one For example, how do we enable community members to digitize and contextualize their material. In this, we need contributions from all partners to come to a full picture of possibilities and pitfalls.
