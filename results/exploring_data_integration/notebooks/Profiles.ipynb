    "## Aim\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is intended to sum up the previous notebook in this series. The aim was to see whether it is possible to analyze a whole archive collection consisting of system cards with information by an institution, combining classic sampling techniques with computer vision.\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea was to make profiles:\n",
    "\n",
    "- profiles of types of cards that give an idea what to expect on the cards\n",
    "- profiles of groups of migrants and the cards they contain\n",
    "\n",
    "For this, we systematically describe what we know of the archive and the cards, starting with a description of the collection, of the cards and of the sample we took and then going on to the different analyses we performed using the sample, computer vision and a combination.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Collection description \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The archive consisted of fifty-one drawers with system cards from the Dutch consulates in Australia with information about the Dutch emigrants that migrated to that continent after WWII until 1992, when active Dutch migration policy stopped and the registration system with it. Each of the drawers contained some 1000 cards, adding up to 51,525 all together. \n",
    "In the early 2000s the cards were shipped to the Netherlands and transferred to the National Archives in The Hague, where they now are accessible under inventory number (NL-HaNA) NT00335. \n",
    "\n",
    "At the time of transferral a simple database was compiled with some basic data on the migrant units on the cards, with a basic ordering of a sequel number that corresponded to the order in which the cards were processed.\n",
    "\n",
    "The cards were also scanned, but no relation between the card-image (2 per card, a front and a back) and the records was maintained. In effect, there are now 51,525 records and 103,050 images, organized by folders that (supposedly) correspond to the the original drawers and have designations like _\"Brisbane A-B\"_ or _\"Sydney-F-H\"_. According to the database, the consulates Brisbane, Melbourne and Sydney were represented. On basis of these first assessments, we have no way of telling whether this is all there ever was. It is also unclear whether there were once more extensive files on the migrants at the consulates. If there were, they have been destroyed at some time.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assessment\n",
    "\n",
    "This ensemble is in itself a closed whole, of which the database gives only a very superficial access. It is also likely that the database contains errors, but they are difficult to assess without comparing them to the cards. The cards are difficult to process by conventional computerized methods like ocr, as they contain a mixture of type-written and handwritten text in a variety of hands. Moreover, texts are dispersed over the cards. On first inspection they contain some model that prescribed where to put the information, but this was maintained loosely and not consistently over the cards. \n",
    "<figure>\n",
    "  <img src=\"images/sample_cards_aarsse.png\" alt=\"sample card image\"/>\n",
    "  <figcaption><em>Sample card image</em></figcaption>\n",
    "</figure>\n",
    "\n",
    "A completely computerized analysis of the data-set was therefore impossible, but because of the amount of data, hand processing was also out of the question because of the sheer size. In this, this dataset is by no means unique. In most of the twentieth century, many, many card files were kept for administrative purposes by probably all governments in the world. And while an unknown portion of these physical databanks were later transferred to computer databases in one form or another, and many others were destroyed because they were obsolete, the archives still hold considerable numbers of these card files. They all share the problem that they usually are hard to process in a computerized way, and too large to grasp by manual methods. Apart from the intrinsic value of the Dutch-Australian migrant card-files, this makes exploring them also important from a methodological point of view.\n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, these cards were only part of the story. While we had to assume that all of the original files the cards gave access had been destroyed, there were at least the immigrant files in the Australian archives of the Immigration Services, kept in the Australian archives. Because the cards have information about a very large proportion of all post-WWII Dutch migrants to Australia\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Approaches\n",
    "\n",
    "We decided to approach the migrant cards using a combination of manual and computerized methods, keeping in mind that using any computer assisted method was preferable even for minor tasks, because they could save time. Essentially, this was a two-person endeavour, with occasional help by volunteers and interns, unless we would be able to get a grant. The complexity of the tasks at hand and the unknown territory required a step-wise approach, some of which were devises at the onset and others we worked out along the way.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Sample \n",
    "\n",
    "The cards contain mixed data about migrants in mixed form. Some of the data are in typescript, while others contain additional information in handwriting, often very small. \n",
    "To get a better feel of what was on the card, Wouter Schalenkamp, intern at the project, took a one percent sample of the cards, consisting of each one-hundredst card. TODO: elaborate\n",
    "The sample did not bring to light any strange properties of the collection, as the cards appeared to be more or less evenly distributed over the different consulates. In this first analysis, there were no major differences between the consulates either. There is no administrative description of the collection that survives in the archives, so that we had to derive all information from it.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Computer vision techniques\n",
    "\n",
    "At the current situation of computer assisted analysis, it is impossible to do a complete conversion of the cards to text. The information is spread unevenly over them, it is neither running text nor tabled information. OCR on the typescript parts performs well, but information is scattered. Even if there are some cards that consist of fully typed text, they are exceptions and they are not useful for full-scale analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "### method\n",
    "\n",
    "Computer vision makes it possible to determine what we have described as the _information density_ on the cards: by determining the density of typing and scribbled notes, it is possible to determine which cards contain a lot of information and which cards are empty. There are several ways to make the computer 'see' the writing on the cards, by distinguishing patterns of pixels. We tried several, but different methods did not yield significantly different results, so we adopted the measuring of the edges on the cards. This translates to a number, in which a higher number corresponds to a more information dense card. The computer is not able to distinguish all cards equally well. Cards with either colored backgrounds or colored or faint writing and typing was recognized less, resulting in wrong density numbers. As there is no obvious way to correct this, and some sampling made it clear that these were exceptions anyway, we decided to leave it at this.\n",

    "\n",
    "The images and their densities, the basic database and the sample were the material we wanted to combine to explore the data further. The idea is that they can be combined and explored to see which are the important features of the migrant and _if_ and _how_ they translate to card densities. The assumption behind this is that important features also leave their traces in the distribution of information on the cards, but we have no clue whether this is also true or if there is another mechanism behind this. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is written afterwards, but before we start analysis it is a good idea to realize what these cards actually describe. It would seem that they describe the lives of the migrants, but actually they are the records of the interactions of the administrative apparatus of the Dutch-Australian consulates with the migrants that arrived at different times in Australia from 1945 to 1992. All sorts of policy decisions and adminstrative procedures and their changes could have left their traces in the archive, in addition and sometimes combined with the vicissitudes of the migrants and their interations with the consulates. \n",

In the following graph we plotted the numbers as bars, but the real distribution appears from the two percentage tables. The second table (samenstelling_rest_norm2) shows the distribution of the number of migrants as a percentage of the total number of cards, divided into the card density distribution. In other words, if you take a sample of cards, it will have a distribution over the different categories of family composition (Alone, Couple and Family) of the percentages shown. From this, it appears there, for example if we select dense cards, we will find 45.8% migrants travelling alone, 14.8% travelling as a couple, and 39.4% travelling as families.\n",
    "\n",
    "But the first table shows that for the different migrant groups the distribution over the different categories is rather different. For example, 34.8% of the migrants travelling alone had cards in the 'dense' category, versus 33.9% of the couples and 33.3% of the families. These numbers are not so different after all.\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, all types of migrants (according to the unit typology of _alone, couples, and family_) had an almost equal chance of having a dense cards. The actual larger numbers of 'alone' and 'family' migrants in the 'dense' category should be attributed to the larger of number of migrants in this category compared to those in the 'couple' category.\n",
